            ALICE was beginning to get very tired of
            sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
            nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
            the book her sister was reading, but it had no
            pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is

            burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
            after it, and was just in time to see it pop
            down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
            In another moment down went Alice after
            it, never once considering how in the world
            she was to get out again.
            <br />
            The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
            tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
            down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment
            to think about stopping herself before she found
            herself falling down what seemed to be a very
            deep well.

            Either the well was very deep, or she fell
            very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she
            went down to look about her, and to wonder
            what was going to happen next. First, she tried
            to look down and make out what she was
            coming to, but it was too dark to see anything :
            then she looked at the sides of the well, and
            noticed that they were filled with cupboards
            and bookshelves: here and there she saw maps
            and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down
            the use of a book,” thought Alice, “ without
            pictures or conversations ?”

            <h4>Sub-section 2</h4>
            “Well !” thought Alice to herself, “ after
            such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
            tumbling down stairs ! How brave they 'll all
            think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
            the house !” (Which was very likely true.)
